Hello, my name is Tim, I'm junior frontend developer. I was born in Petrozavodsk, but now I'm studing in BSTU Voenmeh in the faculty of software engineering. I started learning frontend in October 2022. There were months where I did almost nothing, but others were quite productive. I started from youtube and then I read different documentation on learnJS and webdocs. Some were difficult, but ле handle it. I heard about this course on meetup, so I went on 0 stage, I finished it in top 100 and then a went on the 1st stage, now I am at 500's place. Also I found of programming, but most of all I like frontend development, I want to become better every day and that is my purpose.
